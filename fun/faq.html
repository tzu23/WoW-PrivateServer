        <p>Please, refer to this section before asking questions related to the server. Use the search function on our forum or Discord. Most of them have already been answered before. This will save you the wait before someone answers you specifically.</p>

<p><span style="color: red">Q</span>: I can’t start the game, error “cannot stream required archive data“.
<br>
<span style="color: blue">A</span>: You should use the TwinStar CDN. Just replace the WoW.mfil in your main game directory with the one you can find on our website: https://apollo-wow.com/files/WoW.mfil</p>

<p><span style="color: red">Q</span>: My game is crashing when entering certain areas/instances.
<br>
<span style="color: blue">A</span>: Same as above, use the TwinStar CDN.</p>

<p><span style="color: red">Q</span>: I cannot log in to the game, what to do?
<br>
<span style="color: blue">A</span>: Make sure that you followed all steps from the How to connect section. Your Game account also needs to be verified via email address first. Make sure that you login via your account name, not the email address. Using the wow.exe file (not wow-x64.exe) is recommended.</p>

<p><span style="color: red">Q</span>: The game is offering me two different realms, Apollo and PTR. What’s the difference between them?
<br>
<span style="color: blue">A</span>: Apollo is an international (EN/CZ/SK) realm that resulted from merge of Hades and Artemis. Hades was an international project launched in Q4 ’17 with progressive content schedule. Artemis was a highly progressed realm with a majority of CZ/SK players. There were some international guilds. Artemis was an older and more progressed realm. PTR is a test realm only. You can get instant level 85 and buy gear from custom vendors spawned in major cities for your testing needs.</p>

<p><span style="color: red">Q</span>: I am experiencing serious lag and other people seem fine, what’s wrong?
<br>
<span style="color: blue">A</span>: Try all three login server options listed in “how to connect” to determine which one provides you with the lowest latency.
<br> 
If you use a different client than ours, make sure you only have one realmlist file, in the folder specified by the first line of text in Config.wtf. We have a guide on our Discord server, pinned message in the #support room.</p>

<p><span style="color: red">Q</span>: The realm seems empty, I can’t see other people chatting.
<br>
<span style="color: blue">A</span>: We use two global chat channels, just type /join world (EN/CZ/SK/EN allowed).</p>

<p><span style="color: red">Q</span>: How can I disable the arena announcement in the chat?
<br>
<span style="color: blue">A</span>: Remove the checkmark on “Battleground Neutral” in your chat settings.</p>

<p><span style="color: red">Q</span>: What’s the population on the Apollo project?
<br>
A: TwinStar project is not revealing any information regarding population on any project we are running. The most common answer you will see is 49, the cap of ingame /who search. Also the addon Census+ isn’t really accurate, because it doesn’t deal with that restriction correctly.</p>

<p><span style="color: red">Q</span>: I received an error message “This account has been suspended…”, when logging in.
<br>
<span style="color: blue">A</span>: Your account has been temporarily banned. More information can be found on the main page (log in to the account manager and search for recent bans). In case of doubts or a need for further clarification, turn to the person who has given you the ban. He or she will provide you with more facts about the reason and length of your ban.</p>

<p><span style="color: red">Q</span>: When I try to log in, I keep receiving an error message “This World of Warcraft account has been closed and is no longer available for use”.
<br>
<span style="color: blue">A</span>: This means there is a ban on your IP. In most cases, the cause of your ban is that you have put in your password or account name incorrectly too many times. Such bans typically last 10 minutes. You can find the cause of such ban and an unban date in the account manager.</p>

<p><span style="color: red">Q</span>: I think my ban is unfair. Who should I ask for help?
<br>
<span style="color: blue">A</span>: Your ban can be reviewed by the GameMaster (GM) who has given it to you (can be found in the account manager) or you can ask a head GM. All ban appeals are to be dealt with via private messages on Discord or forum.</p>

<p><span style="color: red">Q</span>: I forgot my game account password, what to do?
<br>
<span style="color: blue">A</span>: A new password can be sent via the account manager. You will find this option on the main page of the account manager which is located on our main website www.twinstar-wow.com.</p>

<p><span style="color: red">Q</span>: I have trouble logging into Bugtracker.
<br>
<span style="color: blue">A</span>: You need a forum account for this, not your game account. Make one and confirm it with your email and you’re set. Make yourself familiar with how to report bugs before posting here, we do have a guide for it.</p>

<p><span style="color: red">Q</span>: I have seen someone breaking the rules ingame, what to do?
<br>
<span style="color: blue">A</span>: Provide us with appropriate evidence and a description of what you have seen. Create a ticket on Discord under #ticket-submit. Make sure to read the instructions that are written in that channel.</p>

<p><span style="color: red">Q</span>: Do you transfer characters from other projects? Do you offer instant high level characters?
<br>
<span style="color: blue">A</span>: No, we do not, but you can use our character auction containing characters properly leveled up by TwinStar players. These characters can be purchased for Stars available through the DONATE system. By donations you also financially support the server. You can find more details about such auctions in the Characters auction section of the Account manager.</p>

<p><span style="color: red">Q</span>: When the server crashed I lost an item I have obtained/ bought. Can it be returned?
<br>
<span style="color: blue">A</span>: Any item, XP or honor lost during the server crash CANNOT be restored! The same applies to items, honors etc. lost due to the player’s own fault. There is an automatic save function on the server which regularly saves all characters. At present, we only handle issues with loot from Cataclysm raid bosses.</p>

<p><span style="color: red">Q</span>: I have an ingame issue, what am I supposed to do?
<br>
<span style="color: blue">A</span>: Submit an ingame ticket <a href="contact.html">here</a>. Also of course you are able to contact us using Apollo Discord.</p>

<p><span style="color: red">Q</span>: I have an issue related to account or other (not in-game) related stuff, what should I do?
<br>
<span style="color: blue">A</span>: Contact us using Apollo Discord #support channel.</p>

<p>However, if your problem is regarding an account activation, non-existing account emails, donations or anything character auction related, please contact an administrator under <a href="contact.html">contact</a> page.</p>

<p><span style="color: red">Q</span>: What should I do if I don’t have access to the accounts email anymore?
<br>
<span style="color: blue">A</span>: If you have lost your password or forgot your email, you have to try to remember it and/or contact your email provider. The email address is the key to everything and without email address you don’t have a way to provide us a valid proof that you are a legitimate account owner.</p>
